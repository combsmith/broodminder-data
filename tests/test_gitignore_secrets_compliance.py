"""Compliance test for the `.gitignore` secrets baseline (`gitignore_secrets_block`).

The org push-protection standard requires every repo to carry the managed
"combsmith secrets baseline" block in its `.gitignore` as the first layer of
defense against committing credentials. Conformance is defined by the org
gitignore-standard: the baseline lives between canonical BEGIN/END markers and the
weekly compliance audit hash-matches the content between them.

This test is a local regression guard so the baseline (notably `*.pem`, the pattern
flagged in issue #17) cannot silently disappear between audits. It is text-based so
it runs with only ``requirements.txt`` installed (no YAML parser needed), mirroring
``test_ci_compliance.py``.
