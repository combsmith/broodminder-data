"""Compliance tests for the CI secret-scan job.

Enforces the org push-protection standard's `secret_scan_ci_job_present`
requirement: the primary CI workflow must run gitleaks, and the repo must
ship a root .gitleaks.toml so `--config .gitleaks.toml` resolves.

Ref: petry-projects/.github/standards/push-protection.md#required-ci-job

Also enforces the dev-lead caller-stub channel pin
(`dev-lead-stub-agent-ref`): the stub must pass `with: agent_ref:
dev-lead/<channel>` and pin the reusable's `uses:` ref to the same channel.

Ref: petry-projects/.github/standards/ci-standards.md#dev-lead-agent

These are text-based checks so they run without extra dependencies (CI only
installs requirements.txt, which has no YAML parser).

# --- dev-lead channel-form regression guard (issue #67) -----------------------
#
# The flaky `.github/workflows/sonarcloud.yml` failures flagged by Fleet Monitor
# (issue #67) were pytest failures, not SonarCloud endpoint flakiness: an org
# standards-sync updated `dev-lead.yml` to the versioned channel
# `dev-lead/v1-stable` before DEV_LEAD_CHANNEL was broadened to accept the
# `v<N>-` form. Because sonarcloud.yml (and ci.yml) run the full suite to
# generate coverage, that mismatch surfaced as a "SonarCloud" workflow failure.
#
# These guards pin the accepted/rejected channel forms directly against the
# regex so a future narrowing of DEV_LEAD_CHANNEL cannot silently reintroduce
# that failure class — independent of whatever channel `dev-lead.yml` happens to
# pin at any given moment.
