"""Resilience tests for the CI pipeline's external network downloads.

The primary CI workflow (`ci.yml`) is otherwise fully deterministic and offline:
`live` contract tests skip without ``BROODMINDER_API_KEY`` and the repo-settings
live check skips without a GitHub token, neither of which the test step injects.
The only nondeterministic steps are the two external downloads:

  * ``Install dependencies`` — ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` (PyPI), and
  * ``Install gitleaks``     — ``wget`` of the release tarball (GitHub Releases).

A single transient failure in either fails the whole run — the cause of the
Fleet Monitor's ~20% (1/5) failure-rate warning. These guards pin that both
steps retry-with-backoff so a flaky index/CDN doesn't fail CI, while still
running the original command and (for gitleaks) verifying the checksum.

The SonarCloud workflow (`sonarcloud.yml`) shares the same ``pip install``
exposure: it installs ``requirements.txt`` to generate the coverage report the
scan uploads. Its SonarCloud scan step is already resilient (continue-on-error
plus a retry step), so the remaining nondeterministic failure point is that pip
install. Fleet Monitor flagged the workflow at a 26.1% failure rate (issue #99);
the guard below pins the same retry-with-backoff there.

These are text-based checks so they run with only ``requirements.txt`` installed
(no YAML parser), mirroring ``test_ci_compliance.py``.
